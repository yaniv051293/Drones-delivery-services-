Project: C#.net 
The project simulates drones' delivery services company based on three layers architecture.

Description of the project interface:
From the main screen of the manager, you can view the windows of the list of customers, the existing packages or the drones.
By clicking on a drone you can see its details such as status, location and battery status.
When the battery runs out the drone is sent to a charging station.
There is also a simulator button that activates the drone and shows it in action.
